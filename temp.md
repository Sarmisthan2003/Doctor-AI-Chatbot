INFO:__main__:Processed response from meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct API: The image depicts a skin condition characterized by red, circular patches. The condition appears to be ringworm, also known as tinea. Ringworm is not caused by a worm but is a fungal infection that affects the skin, causing circular patches with a red border and scaly skin. The elements visible in this picture are:

*   **Red, Circular Patches:** The primary feature of the condition, which are likely the lesions caused by the fungal infection.
*   **Scaly Skin:** The white, flaky patches on the skin's surface, indicating scaling and possible dryness.
*   **Inflamed Border:** The red border around the circular patches, suggesting inflammation and irritation.
*   **Skin Texture:** The image shows the texture of the skin, which appears to be inflamed and irritated.

The image provides a visual representation of the symptoms associated with ringworm, a common fungal skin infection.
